# Question 1: VueJS

Create a simple counter component using Vue.js. The component should have the following features:

- A display area showing the current count.
- Buttons to increment and decrement the count.
- A button to reset the count to zero.

The provided starter code includes only the `.vue` Single-File Component. **You do not need to load the component into a VueJS application, but you may do so if you wish.** Our goal is to evaluate your knowledge of VueJS—or your ability to pick it up—but we are not concerned with minor syntax or API errors.

**Note:** If you are more comfortable using another frontend framework (like React), you may do so, but you will not have starter code.

## Additional Notes

Simple project created with `npm init quasar`. Counter implementation is located at `src/components/CounterItem.vue`.

## Project Setup

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```bash
npx quasar dev
```
